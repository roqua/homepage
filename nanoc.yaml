# A list of index filenames, i.e. names of files that will be served by a web
# server when a directory is requested. Usually, index files are named
# “index.html”, but depending on the web server, this may be something else,
# such as “default.htm”. This list is used by nanoc to generate pretty URLs.

# The data sources where nanoc loads its data from. This is an array of

# Configuration for the “check” command, which run unit tests on the site.
checks:
  # Configuration for the “internal_links” checker, which checks whether all
  # internal links are valid.
  internal_links:
    # A list of patterns, specified as regular expressions, to exclude from the check.
    # If an internal link matches this pattern, the validity check will be skipped.
    # E.g.:
    #   exclude: ['^/server_status']
    exclude: []
